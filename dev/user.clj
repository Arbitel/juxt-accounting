;; This namespace will be loaded on repl, test and run (that means both dev and prod) - like Pedestal

;; So developers need to issue the (dev) command as the first thing they do before starting the service.

;; TODO: Add a way of starting the prod service via the Leiningen repl. There should be analogs.

;; This indirection is in place because of this:
;;
;; "Some of my Relevance coworkers like this approach, others find it
;; too constraining. The Pedestal team uses pieces of this technique,
;; such as the :dev profile, but without tools.namespace. They were
;; annoyed that compiler errors prevented them from starting a new REPL,
;; so they came up with a variation that uses a function in user.clj to
;; load another file called dev.clj." --
